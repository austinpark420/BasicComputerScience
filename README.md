## What is Computer Science
> Study of Computer and computational systems something like software and software systems
---

## Computer
> Compute + er  
    * Compute : Not only implies a strictly arithmetic process but aslo applies rules in a systematic way   
    > cf. calculation : just arithmetic calculate and can't store impormation
---

## Basic Computer Architecture

![Computer Architecture](/img/computerArchitecture.png
)

* Control Unit : contains the address (location) of the instruction being executed at the current time
* Arithmetic Logic Unit : `+, -, *, /, AND, OR, NOT `
---

## CPU(Central Processing Unit)
> CPU is handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer
---

## Memory
> Memory is physical device capable of storing information temporarily or permanently

![memory](img/memory.png)

* Primary Storage
    * RAM(Random Access Memory)
        * RAM is hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer
        * when computer is turnning on, RAM is working
    * Cache Memory
        *Cache Memory is high-speed access area that can be a reserved section of main memory or on a storage device
---

## OS(Oerating System)
> OS is manages computer hardware and software resourse and provides common services for computer programs.

    **Hardware <--> `Operating System` <--> Application Software <--> User**
---

## Type of OS
* Unix
    * Straing in the 1970s by AT&T
    * Made by Thompson, Denis Ritchie and others

    Cf. Unix-like : Solaris, BSD, MacOs ...

* Linux
    * Unix-clone OS
    1991.9.17 made by Linus Torvalds
    
    Cf. Linux-like : Android, Tizen, Chrome Os

* Window
    * History of Window
        * CP/M-DOS --> MS-DOS
        * Windows 1
        * Windows 3.1
        * Windows 95
        * Windows XP
        * Windows Vista
        * Windows 7
        * Windows 8
        * WinDows 10

# Computational Thinking
> Computational Thinking is Process of generalization of Problem that hasn't correct answer
---

## Process of Computational Thinking
* Problem formulation (abstraction)  
* Solution expression (automation)  
* Solution execution and evaluation (analyses)

# Pseudocode
> Pseudocode is present computer program or algorithm as a language to understand human 
---

## Merit of Pseudocode
* Design a program it works as a rough sketch
* Esay to code modify and divide
* Role of comment
---

## How to write pseudocode
> It doesn't have rule(it on you)
---

# Algorithm
> Algorithm is a series of contained steps which you follow in order to achieve some goal, or to produce some output
---

## Algorithm Conditions
* Clarity
* Has external input
* Has one or more result
* Finite trial
* Simplicity
---

## Clarity
* Time complexity == big O notation
    > Change a time pattern as data increase

* Type of big O notation
    * 1
    * log n  
    * n  
    * n log n  
    * n^2  
    * n^3  
    * 2^n  
    * n!
---

## Sort Algorithm
* O(n^2)
	* [Bubble sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=52&v=nmhjrI-aW5o)  
       * Works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
	* [Selection sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=76&v=xWBP4lzkoyM)  
        * An array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
	* [Insertion sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGzPmgsI-pQ)  
        * Builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time
* O(n log n)
	* [Merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSceec-wEyw)  
        Divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves
	* [Heap sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSceec-wEyw)  
        * A comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure
	* [Quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgBzjlCcFvc)  
        * It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot

# Data Structure
* Data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently
---

## Data Structure in Web Development

* Stack
    * stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations  

        ![Stack](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Lifo_stack.png/700px-Lifo_stack.png
    )
    > LIFO [Last in, First out]  
* Queue
    * queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order  

        ![Queue](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Data_Queue.svg/600px-Data_Queue.svg.png)  
        > FIFO [First in, First out]
